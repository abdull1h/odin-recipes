    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy, healthy homemade chicken shawarma is a huge fan-favorite around here, for good reason! The secret is
        in the simple shawarma spice mixture, which makes all the difference. My step-by-step tutorial and video show
        you exactly how to make this delicious chicken! Serve it in pita pockets with tahini sauce and this lazy salad,
        and call it dinner! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>garlic power</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the cumin, turmeric, coriander, garlic powder, sweet paprika and cloves. Set aside the
            shawarma spice mix for now.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken thighs dry and season with salt on both sides, then thinly slice into small bite-sized
            pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl. Add the shwarma spices and toss to coat. Add the onions, lemon juice and
            olive oil. Toss everything together again. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight (if you don't have
            time, you can cut or skip marinating time.</li>
        <li>When ready, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Take the chicken out of the fridge and let it sit in room
            temperature for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the marinated chicken with the onions in one layer on a large lightly-oiled baking sheet pan. Roast
            for 30 minutes in the 425 degrees F heated-oven. For a more browned, crispier chicken, move the pan to the
            top rack and broil very briefly (watch carefully). Remove from the oven.
        </li>
    </ol>
